# 为什么说用AI学英语大有可为

![cover](cover.jpg)

昨天发了一篇文章《[如何用AI背英语单词](../2023-07-14-ai-english/index.html)》，其实只是AI用于学英语的一个小方面。今天继续说说为什么用AI学英语大有可为。

我从自己、以及我家娃学英语的过程就可以总结出学英语最大的问题在哪。语言学习，和数理化不太一样，它不是一层一层递进，而是很长时间会停留在一个平台期，经过大量的听说读写可能就上了一个台阶，也可能还停留在原来的水平，结果学校按考试要求继续往前学，往往就是真实水平低于教学水平，长时间没有看到有效提高带来的正反馈，所以越学越没有信心。

如果实际水平只是略低于教学进度，还可以努力赶赶，如果实际水平大大低于教学进度，那就不是赶的问题了，得回头补基础。所以学英语，总能看到有人轻松拿满分，有人却学得非常吃力。

学语言还不像数学，数学不会就是不会，英语呢，能看懂个大概，但是题还是错一半，所以，为啥一对一最有效果，因为一对一可以根据学生水平，因材施教。在学校里，一对50，做不到，只能按大纲走。

而用AI学英语，恰恰是最有可能做到一对一量身定制的。还是以背单词为例子，假设我就会2000个词汇，高考英语是没指望了，因为词汇量不够，根本读不懂，怎么破？

用AI来定制学习计划，比如就会2000个单词，那就把这2000单词列出来，扔给AI，告诉它，就按这个水平，生成阅读题，训练阅读能力。遇到不会的单词，就用会的这2000个单词解释，英文解释英文，能读懂英文解释，更有利于学习，实在不行，就让AI给出中文翻译。

至于写作，更是不在话下。我用我家娃英语卷的原题为例，介绍一项发明，比如Internet，扔给AI，它会在几秒钟内写出来：

> Greetings! I am Li Hua, a student fascinated by the marvels of science and the profound impact they have on our lives. In this essay, I would like to talk about one invention that, in my opinion, is the most important and has greatly changed the world -- the Internet.
> 
> The Internet was initially developed in the late 1960s as a network research project by the U.S. Department of Defense. However, through decades of evolution, it has transformed into a massive global communication system that interlinks computers and computer networks around the world. Today, no invention has permeated our lives so intimately as the Internet, which has essentially transformed the way we communicate, work, study, and even entertain ourselves...

但是这个用词太高级了，不符合我的英文水平怎么办？让它用中学生的词汇写：

> Hello everyone, my name is Li Hua, a high school student from China. Today, I would like to talk to you about one of the most important inventions that have significantly changed our lives. I believe the most significant invention so far has been the Internet, also known as the World Wide Web.
> 
> The Internet was initially created for military use in the USA in the 1960s, but it was not until the 1990s when it was made accessible to the public, marking the beginning of a global technological revolution...

如果还是觉得生词太多，那就让它用小学生的词汇写：

> Hello, my name is Li Hua and I am a primary school student. Today, I want to talk about a discovery that I think is incredibly important – the Internet. Although I am only a little kid, I cannot imagine my life without this amazing innovation.
> 
> The Internet is a huge network that connects computers all around the whole wide world. It’s like a giant web that links everyone together. It was first created many, many years ago, even before I was born! It started out as a project by the United States government, but soon spread across the globe and now almost everyone can use the Internet...

以上只是一个粗略的引导，摸索一段时间完全可以按照自身英文水平引导AI，真正实现一对一定制化学习，只不过现阶段还缺少能实时跟踪学生水平，便于使用的产品。
